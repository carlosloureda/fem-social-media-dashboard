# Frontendmentor challenge - Social media dashboard

Project built with:

- ReactJS
- EmotionJS
- TypeScript

Our focus on this project was to teach on my live coding stream at [twitch](www.twitch.tv/loucoding) mainly:

- Code structure for themes
- Using APIs and pushing the project further.

## Using the Figma design file

Using this design file will help you practice building projects in the same way professionals do. Seeing the details in the design will help you improve your accuracy when building projects and build projects faster.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is an extremely popular design tool that has a generous free tier and can also be used on both Windows and Mac computers.

To get started with Figma, [download the correct app for your operating system](https://www.figma.com/downloads/). You can then open the app and open the `.fig` design file by dragging it over the app and dropping it into the projects home screen.

If you're going to use the Desktop App, you don't need to download the Font Installer from the downloads page. But if you're planning on using the Figma web app you should download and install it to ensure the fonts show up correctly.

If you haven't used Figma before, we strongly recommend reading this [‚ÄúEverything Developers Need To Know About Figma‚Äù article on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/figma-developers-guide/) to help you get up to speed.

We hope you enjoy the challenge! üôÇ
